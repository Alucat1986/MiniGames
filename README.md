# MiniGames [C++]
Since I really want to get into game development, I want to start with cloning smaller games, and actually finishing them. I will use the SFML Library for now as I am more used to it, but maybe I will dabble into other libraries as well at other points (or for other projects).

## Install
To build the repository follow the steps:

1) Open a console and navigate to the repository folder
2) Use `premake5` if you have it installed on your pc, otherwise `3rdParty/Binaries/Premake/YourOS/premake5`

For windows:
`premake5 vs2022` or `3rdParty/Binaries/Premake/Windows/premake5.exe vs2022`

For Linux:
`premake5 gmake` or `3rdParty/Binaries/Premake/Linux/premake5 gmake`

For Mac:
`premake5 xcode4` or `3rdParty/Binaries/Premake/macOS/premake5 xcode4`
